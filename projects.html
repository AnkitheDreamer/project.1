			In my journey as a budding programming student, I've embarked on creating simple yet impactful projects to solidify my skills. Among these are a straightforward movie poster webpage and a basic pizza ordering webpage.

			The movie poster webpage offers a glimpse into my ability to blend HTML and CSS to create visually appealing layouts. It showcases a collection of movie posters with minimalistic design elements, allowing users to navigate through them effortlessly.
			
			Similarly, the pizza ordering webpage demonstrates my early foray into interactive web development. Constructed using HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript, this webpage enables users to customize their pizza orders by selecting toppings and sizes through simple forms.
			
			While these projects may be modest in scope, they represent the foundational steps I've taken in my programming journey. Through them, I've learned valuable lessons in structuring web pages, implementing user interactions, and troubleshooting common issues, setting the stage for more complex and ambitious projects in the future.
